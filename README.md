# GAN alignment as a preprocessing technique to boost classification accuracy
Author: Santiago Palmero Mu√±oz

This repository includes the Python modules responsable for the creation of the transformed mnist datasets and their classification results shown in section "3.1. IMAGE DOMAIN ALIGNMENT EXPERIMENT" of the Master Thesis "Domain alignment with generative adversarial networks".

Files data_transformer.py and transformers.py are modules that allow for the creation of the transformed mnist datasets shown. File models_pytorch.py contains the classification algorithms used. Notebooks neg_tr_evaluation.ipynb, pca_tr_evaluation.ipynb and noisy_pca_tr_evaluation.ipynb contain the results of the tests shown in the project.
